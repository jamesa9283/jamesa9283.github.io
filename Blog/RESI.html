    <h1> RESI Hackathon: The Man in the Yellow Hat </h1>
	<h2> What is a Hackathon? </h2>
	<p> A Hackathon is defined as such: A hackathon is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including domain experts, collaborate intensively on software projects. This Hackathon was held at Celtic Manor Resort, along side the RESI event.  </p>

	<h2> Day I </h2>
	<p> Day I started, as most events do, with a train ride to my base for the next couple of days. Belly filled with curried noodles and Darjiling tea, I was happily brain storming on the class 802 to Newport. I felt a massive level of de ja vu, this was the exact same route that I took when I went to IMO. I took the same bus aswell, joined by some people that were soon to be my team mates.</p>
	<p> We checked in and we got the Yellow hat that was to be legendary in the recent future. The next part was finding a team to work with, plenty of people were interesting and had many interesting ideas, it was so hard to choose a team. I got adopted by a team eventually, we were to create a web app, a type of search engine that put together health, travel and food for the older demographic. </p>
