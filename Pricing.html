      <p> I offer a couple of services; the first being a website building service, the second a website modernisation service and the third a maintenance service. For all I require a wireframe/sketch sheet of your requirements/website necessities. I also work under the agile approach to programming, so you will get regular updates from me with the code and the aestethic appeal of the site. All my websites also follow the Ethos and Ethics of your company closely. Once the website is up and running the maintenance service I offer keeps your website up to date with the latest browsers and devices. My pricing structure is as follows: </p>
