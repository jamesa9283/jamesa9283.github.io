	  <h6> Date Published: 21/10/2019 </h6>
		  <p> This project is currently my lovejoy, I am working on getting a bit of code and AI working. Its mainly also an excuse to do some AI pratice for my <a href = "./Priestley.html" class = "hyp">algebra engine</a>
		  <h6> Date Published: 26/11/2019 </h6>
		  <p> It has been a month and the project has changed drastically over the past month, the project now follows as this:
		  <ul>
		  <li> To start with, the project will now use arduino ESP8266 to collect and push data to the cloud.</li>
		  <li>I am going to use the service ThingSpeak with MatLab, instead of python for data analysis </li>
		  <li> The end aim of the project to predict big weather changes, instead of finding the source of pollution, although I still aim to do that </li>
		  <li> To reiterate, the project now has two parts: to predict weather events and to show trends in pollution. I shall firstly focus on the weather prediction.</li>
		  </ul></p>
		  <p> I came up with a quick, and very dirty, script to plot datasets:</p>
